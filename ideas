-Take global features into account (especially the total length; with the HMM a very short sequence of the signature have a very high probability)
-Add other features (speed etc...) how to give more importance to some features ?
-Use Hibernate
-Encapsulate HMM into a Serializable class to store it as a blob.
-Store double[] as blob
-Store signatures as well as device name, date etc... One table for TrainingSignatures one for TestSignatures.
-username, buttons ... -> outside of signatureCanvas.js, should be just a library. Callbacks : ok but one for each method (not all of them at the begining), html elements : NO.
-Better name management, only when adding
-Global features :
*Total duration
*Number of pens up
*STILL A PROBLEM WITH GLOBAL FEATURES
